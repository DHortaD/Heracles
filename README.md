# IGS

Repository containing all the required scripts to obtain the results from the paper titled "Evidence from APOGEE for the presence a major building block of the halo buried in the inner Galaxy" (Horta et al 2020) https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200710374H/abstract.

In order to successfully replicate all the plots contained in Horta et al (2020), one must have access to the APOGEE (DR16) and Gaia (DR2) catalogues, as well as the GC catalogue from Horta et al (2020), and the EAGLE numerical simulations. Other requirements include python modules such as numpy, scipy, astropy, galpy and matplotlib. This notebook assumes the IoM have already been determined using galpy (Bovy et al 2016) in a McMillan potential (McMillan et al 2017).
